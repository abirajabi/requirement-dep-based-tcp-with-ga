# Requirement Dependency Based Test Case Prioritization (TCP) with Genetic Algorithm

This implementation can be used to solve Requirement-based TCP problem by optimizing fault detection and requirement dependency coverage rate. We utilize NSGA-II as our main algorithm and set APFD and Dependency Coverage Rate as our fitness functions. 

We are very grateful to David T. Pocock and Pham Ngo Gia Bao since their code inspire us on writing our on approach. You can visit their repos here:
